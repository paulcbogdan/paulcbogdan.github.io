I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Psychology & Neuroscience at Duke University, working with [Roberto Cabeza and Simon Davis](https://cabezalab.org/lab-members/). My current research focuses on the neural correlates of memory, reasoning, and aging. As part of my Ph.D. at the University of Illinois, I also conducted studies on behavioral economics, social cognition, and emotion processing. Long-term, I am interested in clarifying how these different mechanisms coalesce and make up a common cognitive architecture.

My work primarily uses fMRI and behavioral techniques. Generally, I am interested in statistics, computatinal modeling, and the development of new analytical methodologies.


In my personal life, I enjoy sports. My favorite teams are the hopeless Chicago Bears along with the hopeful Illini basketball team. I also like leisurely data science projects. For the most notable ones, I freelanced <em>[two](https://fansided.com/2022/05/12/nba-fanbase-saltiest-analyzing-reddit-posts/) [FanSided](https://fansided.com/2022/08/25/saltiest-nfl-fanbase-analyzing-reddit/)</em> articles on sports fan valence after wins/losses, and I was interviewed by <em>[New York](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/10/is-this-the-last-election-of-politics-betting-site-predictit.html)</em> about one of my election modeling projects.
